# Functional Programming
This repository contains my process of cleaning data with functional patterns and process of finding good research questions from the dataset with a matching concept for The Volkskrant. Full documentation & process can be found [in my wiki](https://github.com/ninoschelcher/functional-programming/wiki)

# The Assignment
During this project we're working together with The Volkskrant, a newspaper based in the Netherlands. Together with the The Datalab department at the Volkskrant we have to come up with a concept related to: **The car in the city**.

Now the goal is to find interesting insights in these (37) datasets about parking and turn these into interesting research questions that we can answer with a datavisualization that the journalists can write an interesting article about. 

# Research Question(s)
After brainstorming and looking at all the datasets I thought that electric cars was an interesting topic, it's upcoming + a relevent topic since electric cars are 'better' for the environment. So I came up with the following research question:
- Is Amsterdam a good city for an electric car?

## Other Research Questions
- How many charging points are available per parking garage in Amsterdam?
- In which district in Amsterdam is it the easiest/hardest to find a charging point for you car?
- Is a parking garage in Amsterdam that has charging points more expensive than one without charging points?
- Are parking garages in Amsterdam with charging points convenient for people who charge their car during work times?

Full documentation about my research questions and explanations are [in my wiki](https://github.com/ninoschelcher/functional-programming/wiki/Brainstorming-&-Research-Questions)
